<p>Execercise 1: Find the area and circumference of a Circle. Use the ff formula.</p>
 * C = 2 π r
 * A = π r 2
 * Use the Math.PI to get the full constant value of PI.

<h1> Instructions: Create the Circle class with the following members: </h1>
 * radius - a private field which is holds the value of radius
 * color - a private field which holds the value of color
 * Circle(string colorName) - a constructor which set the color of instantiated circle
 * SetRadius(int r) - a public method which sets the value of radius+
 * GetRadius() - a public method which return the value of Radius
 * GetColor() - a public method which return the value of Color
 * GetArea() - a public method which return the value of Area
 * GetPerimeter() - a public method which return the value of Circumference+
